# My Repository: [https://github.com/smarder01/sjm19_myfirstrepo](https://github.com/smarder01/sjm19_myfirstrepo)

## I already $${\color{purple}knew}$$ how to: 
- Add repositories 
- Make a new repository
- Fork repositories
This is all stuff I've done before, but that is about it. I also knew there were plenty of things to do in an MD file, but this is my first time doing more than bolding and making a list.

## I **$${\color{green}learned}$$** about: 
1. Pull requests 
2. Different branches.
   1. I knew when making a repository there is more than just the main branch, but I never knew what the purpose of these extra branches was. I now know more about that and can't wait to use this.

I am still a little $${\color{blue}confused}$$ about *pull requests*. I get what they are used for, just not really how to utilize them. I can't wait to read more about pull requests and figure out how to use them.
